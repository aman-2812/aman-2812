👋 Hello, I'm Aman Singh

🔒 I am passionate about security and have a strong background in securing applications and infrastructure. I believe in adopting a proactive approach to identify vulnerabilities and implement robust security measures.

⚙️ I have a keen interest in DevOps practices and strive to bridge the gap between development and operations teams. I advocate for automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to achieve efficient and reliable software delivery pipelines.

🏗️ I have extensive experience in designing scalable and resilient architectures. I enjoy architecting cloud-native solutions, leveraging the power of AWS cloud services. I am well-versed in designing highly available and fault-tolerant systems that can handle varying workloads.

☁️ My expertise lies in Kubernetes and AWS cloud. I have successfully designed and implemented containerized applications on Kubernetes clusters and leveraged AWS services to build secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions.

🌱 I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the security, DevOps, and cloud domains. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences through writing, open-source contributions, and engaging in technical discussions.

📫 You can reach me via [amanksingh77@gmail.com] or connect with me on [www.linkedin.com/in/amansingh-profile]. I'm always interested in collaborating on exciting projects or discussing opportunities related to security, DevOps, and cloud architecture.

Let's secure, automate, and build robust infrastructures together! 💪
